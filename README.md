In this Neural Style Transfer project, we combined the structure of a content image with the artistic patterns of a style image to create a stylized output. Using the pre-trained VGG19 model, we extracted content features from deeper layers and style features from shallow layers. The process involved defining a content loss to preserve the structure, a style loss to replicate artistic textures using the Gram matrix, and optimizing these losses using gradient descent. The final result is an image that retains the content of the original image while adopting the artistic style of the second image, producing a visually striking blend of the two.
